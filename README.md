# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin – IoT Based Touchless Waste Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
**Smart Dustbin – IoT** is an intelligent waste management system designed to promote hygiene and efficiency.
It uses **ultrasonic sensors**, **voice commands**, and **IoT-based monitoring** to enable touch-free operation and real-time alerts.

The dustbin automatically opens when the user gives a voice command and continuously tracks waste levels and moisture to prevent overflow and bad odour.

## 🎯 Features
- Touch-free operation using voice commands  
- Opens automatically when the user says **"OPEN DUSTBIN"**  
- Ultrasonic sensor monitors garbage fill level  
- Alerts user when dustbin is nearly full  
- Moisture sensor detects wet waste  
- Alerts user if dustbin remains wet for a long time to avoid bad odour  
- Real-time alert system (buzzer / app / display)  
- Hygienic and efficient waste disposal

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Voice command **"OPEN DUSTBIN"** is detected.
2. Servo motor opens the dustbin lid automatically.
3. Ultrasonic sensor measures garbage level.
4. Alert is triggered when dustbin is almost full.
5. Moisture sensor detects wet waste.
6. Alert is generated if moisture persists for a long duration.
